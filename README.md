### What is next?
Add manager functionality that provides a different dashboard with information such as; Total Rooms Available for today’s date, Total revenue for today’s date, and Percentage of rooms occupied for today’s date. As well as give the manager the ability to; search for any user by name, View their name, a list of all of their bookings, and the total amount they’ve spent, Add a room booking for that user, and Delete any upcoming room bookings for that user.
